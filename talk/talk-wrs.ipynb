    "1. Make clear why the existing approaches are limited; why we should not settle for workarounds\n",
    "2. Emphasise the strengths and values of existing approaches (the flexibility XML offers its users; the vast amount of tools based on TEI/XML; the large and active user comminity). We do not deny nor ignore these values\n",
    "3. Evaluate the implications of using TAG to model non-linear text: does TAG perform better? Does the TAG model actually comes close to how human readers understand in-text variation?\n",
    "4. What the audience needs to take away:\n",
    "    - A broader understanding of the affordances of data models and how they may serve us best\n",
    "    - The additional value of using a data model that is closely related to your personal understanding of the object you're modeling\n",
    "    - The additional value of looking at textual objects from an informational perspective, so as to find the best algorithmic translation\n",
    "    - How thinking about the best translation also compels you to think about how _you_ understand that specific phenomenon; e.g. is is actually correct to say in-text variation _always_ constitutes non-linear text? Is non-linear text partially ordered information?\n",
    "    - The strenghts of TAG for modeling complex textual features\n",
    "    - The challenges of launching a new data model without completely disgarding the existing ones (I am quite aware we are not the first ones to have come up with \"the best\" way to, well, everything)"

    "The datamodel we use influence our text encoding and defines what textual features we can record. The ways in which we algorithmically express information about text also define how that information can be parsed, queried, and visualised. In short: understanding the strengths and limitations of a data model is vital in order to arrive at a correct text encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most familiar limitation of the OHCO model behind XML is that it doesn't support structures that do not fit within a single hierarchy, which is known as the \"overlap problem\". In the context of studying modern manuscripts, the most important limitation of XML is the inability to encode non-hierarchical features, or more precisely: features that do not fit neatly into one hierarchy. Familiar examples are the combination of documentary and textual features, both relevant to genetically oriented scholars. Over the years, alternative data models for text have been proposed (like LMNL or GODDAG), but these data models mainly focused on overcoming the overlap problem. We think that overlap is not _the_ problem, but a symptom of a higher level problem. Less familiar examples of hierarchy-breaking features are, for instance, discontinuous text or nonlinear text, both equally relevant for a genetic approach to text modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why I start with a high level perspective on what information we want to express, and come to a better understanding of what the best way may be. Instead of proposing ways to circumvent the limitations of XML, this presentation describes a powerful new datamodel for expressing information about complex literary texts in an idiomatic way, without having to resort to workarounds or hacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I want to emphasize that in view of the time this presentation focuses on one small (yet significant) aspect of modern manuscripts: their nonlinearity and how to express it in markup. I am fully aware of the existence of other textual features relevant to genetic studies (_inter alia_ the materiality of the document -- lay out, script, binding, the ductus, the paper, etc -- the separation between _Befund_ and _Deutung_, the process of writing, etc.).

    "1. When we structure information in a way that is close to how we understand it to be, our means of storing and querying become more powerful. An example: the value of XML attributes is always a string (`<date year=\"1928\"/>`) whereas in TAGML this can be an actual number (`[date year=1928><date]`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. TAG is designed according to the principle of separating responsibilities. In XML, most responsibilities are transferred to the application layer; in TAG we organise and structure information at the level of the model. Many textual aspects discussed in this paper can be modeled in, for instance, an XML-transcription with an associated schema and application-level rules. TAGML, however, moves much of that responsibility to the syntax by having explict encoding mechanisms for containment, dominance, discontinuity, non-linearity, and overlap, with the goal of removing ambiguity from the application level. Accordingly, TAGML brings together and expands on qualities of existing formats, and creates an inclusive and definite framework for modeling textual and structural information. I will return to why this is important later."
