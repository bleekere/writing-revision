    "The distinction between intra-documentary and inter-documentary variation (this is also pointed out by the WG-GE as well as by HWG): both constitute non-linear text, but it is not the same. Perhaps this can best be explained by distinguishing between text and document (after all, the document plays a crucial role in distinguishing between in-text variation and document-to-document variation) and then illustrated with a visualisation of a collation hypergraph in which the various path through the text are shown. The labels on the edges will indicate whether a path is found on one document or constituted by the comparison between documents. The distinction, then, is the editors; the hypergraph contains all the information about the variance. (From the WG-GE: \"If two witnesses are collated, we may observe that a word present in one is missing from the other: does it necessarily follow that this is an addition or a deletion, which we would not hesitate to mark with an add or del tag if we are transcribing a single manuscript?\")\n"
