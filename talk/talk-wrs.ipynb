    "1. Make clear why the existing approaches are limited; why we should not settle for workarounds\n",
    "2. Emphasise the strengths and values of existing approaches (the flexibility XML offers its users; the vast amount of tools based on TEI/XML; the large and active user comminity). We do not deny nor ignore these values\n",
    "3. Evaluate the implications of using TAG to model non-linear text: does TAG perform better? Does the TAG model actually comes close to how human readers understand in-text variation?\n",
    "4. What the audience needs to take away:\n",
    "    - A broader understanding of the affordances of data models and how they may serve us best\n",
    "    - The additional value of looking at textual objects from an informational perspective, so as to find the best algorithmic translation\n",
    "    - How thinking about the best translation also compels you to think about how _you_ understand that specific phenomenon; e.g. is is actually correct to say in-text variation constitutes non-linear text; is non-ln\n",
    "    - The strenghts of TAG for modeling complex textual features\n",
    "    - The challenges of launching a new data model without completely disgarding the existing ones (I am quite aware we are not the first ones to have come up with \"the best\" way to, well, everything)"

    "1. When we structure information in a way that is close to how we understand it to be, our means of storing and querying become more powerful. An example: the value of XML attributes is always a string (`<date year=\"1928\"/>`) whereas in TAGML this can be an actual number (`[date year=1928><date]`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. TAG is designed according to the principle of separating responsibilities. In XML, most responsibilities are transferred to the application layer; in TAG we organise and structure information at the level of the model. Many textual aspects discussed in this paper can be modeled in, for instance, an XML-transcription with an associated schema and application-level rules. TAGML, however, moves much of that responsibility to the syntax by having explict encoding mechanisms for containment, dominance, discontinuity, non-linearity, and overlap, with the goal of removing ambiguity from the application level. Accordingly, TAGML brings together and expands on qualities of existing formats, and creates an inclusive and definite framework for modeling textual and structural information. I will return to why this is important later."
