# Writing and Revision
This is presently a private repository created for research into algorithmically expressing information about writing and revision in literary manuscripts. As the title of the repo suggests, Iâ€™m currently writing and revising its contents. 

For more information on our work into tools and datamodels that can support advanced computational research into literary texts, see [TAG](https://github.com/HuygensING/TAG), [HyperCollate](https://github.com/bleekere/hyper-collate) and [TAGML](https://github.com/HuygensING/TAG/tree/master/TAGML).
